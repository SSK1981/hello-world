Just another repository from the hello-world repository tutorial

Just a bit about myself. I've worked as a hardware design, systems and software test engineer. I was also a QA Software Test Engineer intern at Symantec in Santa Monica before they moved to Culver City; worked as a Software Engineer at Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne. Education includes "C Programming and Unix" certificate from UCLA Extension.
